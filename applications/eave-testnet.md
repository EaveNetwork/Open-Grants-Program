**John Whitton:** John Whiton has been passionate about software and technology since high school. He graduated from the University of Queensland in Computer Science and travelled globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures. He has built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric, partnering with firms such as IBM and Deloitte. He then grew the ecosystem for a public blockchain at Harmony. He has worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining his extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain.

John originally met Gavin Wood in 2016 and worked briefly with Tomasz DrwiÄ™ga on Parity before taking a role as CTO of a small Blockchain Startup based on Ethereum which then moved to Hyperledger. He did further [research](https://github.com/johnwhitton/blockchain-eval/blob/master/substrate.md) into Polkadot and Substrate in 2019 and did strategy work on smart contract protocols and digital assets in 2019 including working on Cowri (now shell protocol),a stablecoin exchange protocol, before taking a role with Harmony as an Ecosystem Architect with a focus on Developer tooling and Ecosystem growth. At Harmony, John helped launch the Mainnet while also being intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy.
